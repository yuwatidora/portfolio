                    <p>Hi!</p>
                    <p>My name is Yu Wati Nyi, but friends also call me Dora. I am from Myanmar. I graduated in May 2025 with a B.A. in Computer Science and Economics from Mount Holyoke College. </p>
                    <p>I really like problem-solving, which is why I majored in both Computer Science and Economics. I like programming, building software, and figuring out how to get a desired outcome. I also like to figure out why things are the way they are in the world. In Economics, I get to combine pieces of information and history and analyze the outcome of policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>In my leisure time, I like spending time and laughing together with my family and friends, taking walks, reading, watching good movies, and painting (although I havenâ€™t done it much lately).
                    </p>
